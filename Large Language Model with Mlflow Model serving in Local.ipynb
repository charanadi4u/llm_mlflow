The best way to avoid this problem is to infer the model schema based on a realistic data sample (training dataset) that includes missing values. Alternatively, you can declare integer columns as doubles (float64) whenever these columns may have missing values.

      "* Extra virgin olive oil\n",
      "\n",
      "**Preparation Techniques:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Spaghetti:** No preparation needed, but ensure the spaghetti is stored in an airtight container to maintain freshness.\n",
      "2. **Guanciale or Pancetta:** Slice the guanciale or pancetta into thin strips, approximately 1/4 inch (6mm) thick. This will help it cook evenly and quickly.\n",
      "3. **Eggs:** Crack the eggs into a bowl and whisk them lightly with a fork. Set aside.\n",
      "4. **Parmesan Cheese:** Grate the Parmesan cheese using a microplane or fine grater. This will ensure a smooth, even texture.\n",
      "5. **Parsley:** Chop the parsley leaves finely, if using as a garnish.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Ingredient Staging:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Spaghetti:** Store the spaghetti in a designated container, easily accessible near the cooking station.\n",
      "2. **Guanciale or Pancetta:** Place the sliced guanciale or pancetta on a parchment-lined tray or plate, covered with plastic wrap to prevent drying out. Position it near the cooking station.\n",
      "3. **Eggs:** Keep the whisked eggs in a small bowl, covered with plastic wrap, and place it near the cooking station.\n",
      "4. **Parmesan Cheese:** Transfer the grated Parmesan cheese to a small bowl or ramekin, covered with plastic wrap. Position it near the cooking station.\n",
      "5. **Parsley:** Place the chopped parsley in a small bowl or ramekin, covered with plastic wrap, and position it near the garnishing station.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Cooking Implements Preparation:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Large Pot:** Fill a large pot with salted water and bring it to a boil. This will be used for cooking the spaghetti.\n",
      "2. **Colander:** Place a colander in the sink or near the pot to drain the cooked spaghetti.\n",
      "3. **Skillet or Pan:** Choose a skillet or pan that can accommodate the guanciale or pancetta and eggs. Ensure it's clean and dry before use.\n",
      "4. **Whisk:** Have a whisk ready to mix the eggs and Parmesan cheese.\n",
      "5. **Tongs or Slotted Spoon:** Prepare tongs or a slotted spoon to remove the cooked spaghetti from the pot.\n",
      "6. **Plates:** Set four plates near the garnishing station to assemble the final dish.\n",
      "7. **Olive Oil:** Have a bottle of extra virgin olive oil nearby to add a finishing touch to the dish.\n",
